*Steps to setup and run STRATO Developer Edition using Docker on your machine*

1) Register for access to STRATO Developer Edition trial here: http://developers.blockapps.net/trial

2) Clone this repo using git clone. And `chdir` or `cd` into that folder.

3) Configure docker registry login using the credentials [USER, PASSWORD, REGISTRY] you received via email after your registration for trial:
```bash
docker login -u <USER> -p <PASSWORD> <REGISTRY>
```
4) Launch STRATO services:
- Run:
```bash
chmod +x strato-run.sh
```
- Then run the script (runs `latest` STRATO version by default):
```bash
./strato-run.sh
```

or to run `stable` version:
```bash
./strato-run.sh -stable
```
5) Check if STRATO services are running (using `docker ps`) & view the Strato Management Dashboard at http://localhost/
